Interface

Multiple Inheritence (Like)
public class ..... implements ...., ....., ...., .....{
	
}

We can even have
public class ChildClass extends ParentClass implements A, B, C{
	
}

To be implemented (Inference)
public inference A{
	
}

2. All variables are public static final.
3. All the abstract methods defined in an interface NEED to be implemented.
4. default, static  [java 8+]
